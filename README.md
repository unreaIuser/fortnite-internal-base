# fortnite-internal-base

Here is my fortnite internal base, this is a simple base where you can take your start to learn internal game hacking, it's actually updated for Fortnite v23.10.
Feel free to use it, but atleast give some credits, i made this base is not even 1 hour so don't judge

Do not plan to use this source for making a P2C (unless you modify the entire hooking system & D3D11 PresentScene) which are known detection vectors.
